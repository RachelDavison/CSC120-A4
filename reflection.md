- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My inital impression of encapsulation is that it doesn't really affect much apart from needing accessor methods. I found this assignment a lot easier than the last one, and pretty much everything worked immediately, because the README instructions are practically just a list of what to code, and all I have to do if actually write the if/else statements. I would advise someone taking this course in the future to do Javadoc comments as they go rather than doing them all at the end.
